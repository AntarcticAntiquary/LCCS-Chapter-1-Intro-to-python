'''
GUIs (Graphical User Interface) use images, rather than text, to present menus
They therefore have a much smaller learning curve
However they are a lot more difficult to code

A program with end-users unused to computer science should probably use a GUI
A smaller program with tech-savvy users can use a console menu
Or possibly, there are not enough resources to make a GUI
